### About Me:
Hi, my name is Justin, I came to the US when I turned 9 years old, and I am currently a Junior at Brooklyn College pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. A fun fact about me is that I can touch my fingertips behind my back with my left arm around the waist and right arm over the shoulder, but not the other way around. Let me know if it is the same for you :)
